# Rules

-  ### **NEVER PUSH CODE TO "MAIN" OR "PROJECT DIVERGENCE"**
-  Only pick one task at a time
-  Do NOT fuck up the folder structure (it is fragile as it is)
-  Always comment next to code
-  Do not delete tasks that are done
-  Always add tasks followed by your name and a question mark in the **Suggestions** section
-  Always add tasks in order of urgency
-  If multiple people are assigned the same task then order people by amount of work done
-  When task is done add a checked box in the beginning
-  Add your name next to the task you assigned yourself and do not assign yourself multiple tasks for the future. (no dibs)
-  Do not mindlessly use AI
-  > Always try to do at least two tasks a week

-  [x] ABSTRACT

        Modern wearable technologies aim to enhance human–technology interaction; however, existing smart glasses solutions remain limited in personalization, contextual awareness, and seamless multimodal integration. This paper presents an advanced AI-powered smart glasses system designed to improve daily communication, productivity, accessibility, and decision-making through intelligent, hands-free interaction.
        The proposed system integrates speech recognition, real-time multilingual translation, large language models, computer vision, augmented reality, navigation, and smart home connectivity into a unified wearable platform. A YOLO-based computer vision module enables real-time object detection and face recognition, allowing personalized and context-aware interactions. Indoor navigation is supported through a custom mapping and graph-based routing approach, providing accurate guidance in complex indoor environments.
        Speech input is transcribed using a multilingual automatic speech recognition model and processed by a large language model to understand user intent and generate appropriate responses, which are delivered through natural text-to-speech output. A companion mobile and web platform enables device management, smart home control, accessibility customization, and real-time system monitoring.
        The system is designed with inclusivity as a core principle, supporting users with disabilities through voice-based interaction, visual aids, and hands-free operation, while also enhancing safety and efficiency in daily tasks. Experimental analysis and competitor comparison demonstrate that the proposed solution addresses key limitations of existing smart glasses platforms, particularly in advanced computer vision, indoor navigation, and AI-driven personalization.

Problem Statement: Cognitive Overload and Information Friction

In modern digital environments, users increasingly rely on smartphones to access information, communicate, and perform real-time tasks. However, the smartphone-centric interaction model introduces significant cognitive overload and information friction, particularly in time-sensitive or attention-critical situations. Cognitive overload occurs when users are required to divide their attention between their physical environment and a digital interface, while information friction refers to the unnecessary effort and delays involved in accessing, navigating, and interpreting information.

Pulling out a smartphone to perform simple tasks—such as checking directions, replying to a message, translating speech, or retrieving contextual information—requires multiple sequential actions: locating the device, unlocking it, navigating through applications, and interpreting visual content. Each step interrupts the user’s current cognitive flow and demands focused visual and motor attention. This process increases mental workload, slows task completion, and raises the likelihood of errors.

In real-time contexts such as navigation, social interaction, learning, or driving, these interruptions are particularly inefficient and potentially unsafe. Users must repeatedly shift attention away from their surroundings, resulting in reduced situational awareness and increased cognitive strain. For individuals with disabilities, high workloads, or complex multitasking demands, this interaction model further exacerbates accessibility challenges.

Despite advances in mobile technology, smartphones remain fundamentally screen-centric and reactive, offering limited contextual awareness and proactive assistance. This creates a gap between the user’s intent and the system’s response, forcing users to actively “pull” information rather than receiving it seamlessly when needed.

Therefore, there is a critical need for an interaction paradigm that minimizes cognitive load and reduces information friction by enabling hands-free, context-aware, and continuous access to information. Addressing this problem requires moving beyond traditional smartphone interfaces toward wearable systems that integrate seamlessly with human perception and real-world activity.

This project presents an AI-powered Smart Glasses system designed to enhance daily communication, productivity, accessibility, and indoor navigation. The solution integrates computer vision, speech recognition, large language models, augmented reality, and IoT into a single, low-cost wearable device. Using real-time object detection, multilingual voice interaction (Arabic and English), and AR-based indoor navigation, the system provides hands-free, context-aware assistance in complex indoor environments such as universities, hospitals, and enterprise buildings. By leveraging open-source AI models and affordable hardware, the project delivers an intelligent, scalable, and accessible smart companion that improves user independence, safety, and efficiency while supporting smart building, telecommunication infrastructures and empowering the customer by keeping their data and privacy safe giving them the option of monetizing their own data later down the line. all of that in a one time cost product with no subscriptions unless connected to our cloud for extra services.

-  Prompts:
   1. always use the venv (Smart_Glasses)
   2. index and read the whole project before changing anything, understand the project and make documentation for it
   3. search_web tool works but visiondetect is seemingly broken
   4. "hey nova" works but it queues and waits for me to do manual record before processing the automatic one when they should be separate
   5. "hey nova" should have the same logic as the manual record
   6. clean up repository of useless files
   7. provide ideas on integrating augmented reality to the project in the form of future work
   8. fix text to speech
   9. streamlit crashes sometimes
   10. refactor the code if necessary.
