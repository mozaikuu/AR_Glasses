3. Engineering:-
   -  frame body creation
      -  Freecad?
   -  components -> Modules
      -  Speaker
      -  Mic
      -  Camera
      -  Head on Display (HUD) (somehow)
      -  Microcontroller (esp32, Raspberry pi, etc.)
      -  infrared sensor
   -  wiring
   -  testing
   -  Constraints:-
      -  the chassis should be smart-looking and no bigger than other glasses brands
         -  increase in size and weight cannot be above 2x
      -  the chassis will be made from either CNC Machineing or 3D Printing
         -  if CNC (Preferred) then ...
         -  if 3D Printed then make sure the layer lines of the glasses are parallel to the heatbed for maximum strength.
         -  make sure to make the handles and the main glasses part separately in case of layerline separation.
         -  the glasses should look realistic, futuristic and sci-fi.
