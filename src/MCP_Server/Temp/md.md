Amazon SageMaker (or SageMaker Studio Notebooks)

Full-featured cloud ML platform, lets you build, train, and deploy models beyond just notebooks.

🧑‍💻 What to choose — depending on your needs

Since you:

already have ML / data-science background;

sometimes build deep-learning projects (ResNet, VGG16, etc.);

may need GPUs but don’t have heavy infrastructure;

Here’s what I’d pick depending on your goal:

Quick experiments / smaller models: Deepnote or JetBrains Datalore — easy to launch, no heavy setup, good for data cleaning / analysis.

Training deep-learning models (medium/large): Paperspace Gradient or Amazon SageMaker — more control over resources, better scaling.

Collaboration or project sharing (e.g. with a teammate or student): Hex or Deepnote — good UI, versioning, and easier to share results or dashboards.

If you want full ML lifecycle (training → deployment → serving): Amazon SageMaker or IBM Watson Studio — more complex, but more production-oriented.

⚠️ Things to watch out for vs Colab / Kaggle

Many of these offer free tier or credits, but not all are fully free indefinitely — you’ll need to check usage limits / pricing if you go heavy.

Setup: some platforms might need more configuration (e.g. SageMaker) compared with Colab’s “just open and run.”

Persistent storage / data management: some free notebooks give limited storage; for large datasets you may need cloud-storage integration or external storage.

For big GPU-heavy training, free quotas may be insufficient — you might need paid plan or combine with your local setup.

Since you are a student + robotics & ML hobbyist, I can recommend a full list of 8–10 platforms widespread in 2025, with free-tier availability + GPU support + suitability for teaching & projects.
Do you want me to build that list for you (with links, pros/cons, and notes for students in Egypt / limited resources) so you can test a few fast?
