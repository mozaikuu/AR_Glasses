Risk & go-to-market notes (short)

Regulatory & privacy: Always-on cameras and audio mics draw privacy concerns and local regulation (public spaces, recording consent). Consumer wearables face social/acceptance friction — mitigation: visible recording LEDs, user education, privacy-first UX. (See press coverage on Ray-Ban/Meta and general wearables reporting.) Ray-Ban +1

Supply & manufacturing: High-end optics (waveguides, microLEDs) are supply constrained and costly — plan for alternative suppliers and phased optics rollouts. (See Varjo / Magic Leap premium optics notes.) Varjo +1

Platform risk: Major platform owners (Apple, Meta, Microsoft) control app stores and SDKs. New entrants must either integrate with existing platforms (tethered mode) or offer compelling, cross-platform SDKs. Apple +1

Opportunity map — 12 differentiators for a HUD smart-glasses product

True low-latency text rendering pipeline (optimize for crisp legibility at small font sizes).

High contrast, adaptive brightness waveguide for outdoor readability without glaring power draw.

Ultra-lightweight form factor (≤100 g) with modular batteries to extend session time.

Hybrid compute model — phone/edge tethering plus optional local compute pack for heavy ML.

Open SDK & cross-platform WebXR/AR interface to bootstrap developer ecosystem.

Privacy-first UX features: visible recording indicator, local processing for sensitive data, ephemeral logs.

Power-efficient micro-OLED / microLED variant hardware to maximize battery life.

Low-profile driver/OS integration for quick notifications and glanceable content (optimize for HUD tasks).

Output preferences & quality constraints

Use clear, consistent units (FOV in degrees, resolution as pixels per eye, brightness in nits, weight in grams).

Make tables where possible for specs; avoid burying specs inside paragraphs.

Flag any data that is uncertain or where sources disagree — show both values and cite both sources.

For privacy/legal items cite regulatory or news sources.

Keep the Markdown file ≤ 12,000 words but be exhaustive — prioritize high-quality detail for the top ~30 devices and one-line entries for very obscure models.

If a device manufacturer has multiple SKUs or region variants with different specs, list them as sub-rows or variants clearly.
